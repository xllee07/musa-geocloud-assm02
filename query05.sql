/*
Rate neighborhoods by their bus stop accessibility for wheelchairs:

I established an index by taking the average density of accessible stops, number of acccessible stops and ratio of accessible stops to all stops, and taking the
average of these 3 indicators, normalised in terms of z scores

1) create a boolean indicatin gif stop is accessible or not
from stops:
2) total wheelchair boarding
3) total wheelchair stops
4) wheelchair stops/ total stops

inner join neighborhoods by intersection
group by .name
